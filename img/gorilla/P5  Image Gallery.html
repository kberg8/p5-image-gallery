        <p>“You Had One Job” is an expression used to call attention to perceived blunders made by individuals on the job. According to KnowYourMeme, a website dedicated to documenting Internet phenomena, the earliest known mention of the phrase took place in a scene from the 2001 remake of the heist film Ocean’s Eleven, in which Basher Tarr (a character played by Don Cheadle) scolds his team for missing a step that singlehandedly lead to the failure of an otherwise well-planned vault heist.<a href="file://localhost/Users/kberg/Desktop/p5-image-gallery/jobs.html">View Gallery</a></p>

        <p>Aww…. just look at their cute faces… However we really need to step up and do something about there endanged status. Gorillas are the largest members of the primate family and are closely related to humans, with 98% of their DNA identical to that of humans. Unlike other primates they are terrestrial, meaning they do not climb trees and are land dwelling, inhabiting the tropical rainforests of central Africa. Historically the gorilla has been portrayed as a vicious killer; however they are shy gentle creatures that would not attack humans unless provoked.<a href="file://localhost/Users/kberg/Desktop/p5-image-gallery/gorilla.html">View Gallery</a></p>

        <p>Weddings are quite an emotional occasion for the bride, the groom and the witnesses of the ceremony. We usually hear about the bride’s tears of joy and rarely picture the groom trying to control his emotions, but this is exactly what happened to these lucky guys when they laid eyes on their beautiful brides for the first time.<a href="file://localhost/Users/kberg/Desktop/p5-image-gallery/bride.html">View Gallery</a></p>
